# Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) applied to Proteomics

## Motivation
The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was developed by Tusher et al. (2001) and is based on the t-test with a permutation-based approach to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). The permutation-based FDR has a reduced error type II rate compared to the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (BH) and is currently implemented in [Perseus software](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7493-1_7) for proteomics data analysis. Check the S0 parameter in the statistics session of Perseus.

:bulb:Follow the instructions to install the package [samr](https://github.com/MikeJSeo/SAM) and its dependencies.
The `samr` package is easy to use and has a shiny app that work well. This repositroy is only for help you to customize the results.

### Load the important libraries

```
library(tidyverse)
library(samr)
```

### Load the data as a matrix of abundance values
Check the class of the data and convert it to a matrix if it is not already.
Check the `class()` of the object. If it is a dataframe, coerce it to matrix with `as.matrix()` function.
calculate the average abundance of the proteins per condition and correlate them.
In this example, we are using a matrix of log2 abundance values containing two groups of samples: Control and Treated. The samples are named as `Control_1`, `Control_2`, `Control_3`, `Treated_1`, `Treated_2`, and `Treated_3`. 

```
mean_plot <- abundance_matrix %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    rownames_to_column("protein") %>%
    gather(-protein ,key = "Sample", value = "Intensity") %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
        condition = str_extract(Sample, "Control|Treated"),
        condition = factor(condition, levels = c("Control", "Treated"))
    ) %>%
    dplyr::group_by(protein, condition) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(mean_intensity = mean(Intensity)) %>%
    spread(key = condition, value = mean_intensity) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Control, y = Treated)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") +
    labs(
        x = "Control",
        y = "Treated"
    )

ggsave("mean_plot.png", 
    mean_plot, path = "plots",
    width = 10, height = 10, 
    units = "cm", dpi = 300)
```

Run the SAM analysis using the `samr` package. The function `SAM` requires the following arguments:
- `x`: a matrix of the data to be analyzed.
- `y`: a vector of the condition for the design. Similiar to the condition in the `limma` design matrix.
- `resp.type`: the type of response variable. In this case, we are using a two-class unpaired design.
- `geneid`: the row names of the matrix. So the proteins are identified.
- `S0`: the threshold for the significance of the test statistic.
- `nperms`: the number of permutations to be used in the analysis.
- `fdr.output`: the false discovery rate threshold for the analysis.
- `logged2`: if the data is log2 transformed. If not, do it.
